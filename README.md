Context and objectives: the environmental variables available through conventional weather stations are different from those experienced by insects. We try to get close to the variables experienced by insects, even if we stay far from them (for example we do not cover the differences above / below a leaf, differences in surface layer, ...). These variables are then used to model the phenology of insects (duration and succession of the different stages of an insect's life as a function of environmental variables and their variation over time, within a day and within seasons). Ultimately, the devices are deployed in agricultural plots with, and in parallel, we monitor the dynamics of the populations of crop pest (pheromonal trapping for insects). The objective here is to develop the device for acquiring, transferring, storing and restoring information.

This work benefited from the support of the project PI2P ANR-19-CE32-0001 of the French National Research Agency (ANR). The PI2P project is part of the PRIMA program supported by the European Union.
